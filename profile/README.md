## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to everything Module Federation
Webpack Module federation was created by Zackary Jackson and now officially part of webpack. While the core documentation 
is available on the webpack documentation [site](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/) this GitHub organization 
provides additional resources for folks looking to learn more about Module Federation. 

### What is Module Federation?

Webpack Module Federation (MF) is a feature of webpack that allows for the dynamic loading of multiple versions of a module from multiple independent build systems. 

This allows for the creation of microfrontend-style applications, where multiple systems can share code and be dynamically updated without having to rebuild the entire application. 

It also enables distributed teams and applications with different release cycles to share code without needing to wait for all systems to agree to and deploy a single shared version of a module. 

Additionally, it allows for code-splitting based on routes and other criteria, which can improve performance.

### What Tooling exists for MF

## More Resources

### Highlighted Repositories
- [Examples](https://github.com/module-federation/module-federation-examples) An entire open source learna workspace 
for examples on many frameworks including Next.js, React, Angular, Vue and more.
- [Nextjs-MF](https://github.com/module-federation/nextjs-mf) Previously paid closed-source, now open source, plugins for Next.js module federation and Next.js SSR.

### MF Book
[Practical Module Federation](https://module-federation.myshopify.com/products/practical-module-federation) - The official book on Webpack Module Federation by Jack Herrington & Zack Jackson
"Practical Module Federation" is the first, and only, book on Webpack 5's innovative new live code sharing mechanism. It walks you through everything you need to do to start with Module Federation. It covers the internal implementation of Module Federation, and how Module Federation fits with other sharing options. The book also covers many practical topics include; state sharing across shared code, different deployment options, sharing non-view related code, writing your code to be resilient to code and network failures, and so much more.
